# Overview

I want to help build my portfolio of programming languages. This program is built in the Java language.

Using WASD you move your little character, the @ symbol, around the screen over the other symbols on the screen. If you find the correct symbol, then the game loop ends.

I wrote this software to help me learn more about the Java language.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used the Eclipse IDE to program, and had to import the java.awt.event.* package.

The Java programming language uses a lot of classes and methods. It is like a combanation of c and c++.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* If you move out of bounds of the boar, it crashes.
* If you attempt to start again mid game it allows you to.
* Restarting mid game makes you move twice as fast.
